     <span class="s4">* There are two mechanisms by which an OpMode may be registered.</span>

     <span class="s4">*  1) The preferred method is by means of class annotations in the OpMode itself.</span>
     <span class="s4">*  See, for example the class annotations in {</span><span class="s5">@link </span><span class="s4">org.firstinspires.ftc.robotcontroller.external.samples.ConceptNullOp}.</span>
     <span class="s4">*</span>
     <span class="s4">*  2) The other, retired,  method is to modify this {</span><span class="s5">@link </span><span class="s4">#register(OpModeManager)}</span>
     <span class="s4">*  method to include explicit calls to OpModeManager.register().</span>
     <span class="s4">*  This method of modifying this file directly is discouraged, as it</span>
