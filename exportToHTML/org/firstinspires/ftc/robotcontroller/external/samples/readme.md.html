<span class="s1">## </span><span class="s2">Caution</span>
<span class="s2">No Team-specific code should be placed or modified in this ``.../samples`` folder.</span>

<span class="s2">Samples should be Copied from here, and then Pasted into the team's </span>
<span class="s0">[</span><span class="s2">/TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode</span><span class="s0">](</span><span class="s2">../../../../../../../../../../TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode</span><span class="s0">)</span>
 <span class="s2">folder, using the Android Studio cut and paste commands.  This automatically changes all file and</span>
<span class="s2">class names to be consistent.  From there, the sample can be modified to suit the team's needs.</span>

<span class="s2">For more detailed instructions see the /teamcode readme.  </span>

<span class="s1">### </span><span class="s2">Naming of Samples</span>

<span class="s2">To gain a better understanding of how the samples are organized, and how to interpret the</span>
<span class="s2">naming system, it will help to understand the conventions that were used during their creation.</span>

<span class="s2">These conventions are described </span><span class="s0">(</span><span class="s2">in detail</span><span class="s0">) </span><span class="s2">in the sample_conventions.md file in this folder.</span>

<span class="s2">To summarize</span><span class="s0">: </span><span class="s2">A range of different samples classes will reside in the java/external/samples.</span>
<span class="s2">The class names will follow a naming convention which indicates the purpose of each class.</span>
<span class="s2">The prefix of the name will be one of the following</span><span class="s0">:</span>

<span class="s2">Basic</span><span class="s0">:  	</span><span class="s2">This is a minimally functional OpMode used to illustrate the skeleton/structure</span>
            <span class="s2">of a particular style of OpMode.  These are bare bones examples.</span>

<span class="s2">Sensor</span><span class="s0">:    	</span><span class="s2">This is a Sample OpMode that shows how to use a specific sensor.</span>
            <span class="s2">It is not intended to drive a functioning robot, it is simply showing the minimal code</span>
            <span class="s2">required to read and display the sensor values.</span>

<span class="s2">Robot</span><span class="s0">:	    </span><span class="s2">This is a Sample OpMode that assumes a simple two-motor </span><span class="s0">(</span><span class="s2">differential</span><span class="s0">) </span><span class="s2">drive base.</span>
            <span class="s2">It may be used to provide a common baseline driving OpMode, or</span>
            <span class="s2">to demonstrate how a particular sensor or concept can be used to navigate.</span>

<span class="s2">Concept</span><span class="s0">:	</span><span class="s2">This is a sample OpMode that illustrates performing a specific function or concept.</span>
            <span class="s2">These may be complex, but their operation should be explained clearly in the comments,</span>
            <span class="s2">or the comments should reference an external doc, guide or tutorial.</span>
            <span class="s2">Each OpMode should try to only demonstrate a single concept so they are easy to</span>
            <span class="s2">locate based on their name.  These OpModes may not produce a drivable robot. </span>

<span class="s2">After the prefix, other conventions will apply</span><span class="s0">:</span>

<span class="s1">* </span><span class="s2">Sensor class names are constructed as</span><span class="s0">:    </span><span class="s2">Sensor - Company - Type</span>
<span class="s1">* </span><span class="s2">Robot class names are constructed as</span><span class="s0">:     </span><span class="s2">Robot - Mode - Action - OpModetype</span>
<span class="s1">* </span><span class="s2">Concept class names are constructed as</span><span class="s0">:   </span><span class="s2">Concept - Topic - OpModetype</span>
